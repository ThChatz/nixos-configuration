* TODO nix-os [2/10]
** DONE Move to flakes
** TODO erase root on reboot
https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/
*** DONE @nix subvolume + move /nix/* to it
*** DONE make sure /home is safe
*** TODO impermanence
can figure out more after mounting empty root :)
save wifi/bluetooth
logs
*** TODO mount empty root on boot
*** TODO clean up unecessary subvolumes / files
** DONE cron job for snapshotting home directory
** TODO declarative users + passwords                                  :NEXT:
useful for nixos-rebuild build-vm
maybe hashed password files + git crypt for remotes
*** TODO figure out krops (or similar)
** TODO Organize bootloader entries
*** DONE Group by branch
This will allow a 'stable' branch with tested commits and feature and testing branches with more commits in between
Will make going back to a stable version easier
stable gets a boot entry only when a merge is made(?) so that it's bootloader entries are a git log
*** TODO label versions with date + commit message + tag
Since stable gets boot entries on merge, commit messages should be different between versions :)
*** TODO git hook for creating boot entries when merging on stable
** TODO use deploy-rs for managing different systems + home-manager
** TODO CI/CD
** TODO remote backup system [0/2]
*** TODO git-annex to cloud for specific files
git-annex could also help to reduce snapshot size if i ever store
snapshots on object storage
*** TODO send btrfs snapshots to remote
**** TODO get a "remote"
+ VPS
+ object storage (google, s3, etc.)

  maybe tools for fetching and storing in the snapper subvolume(?)

** TODO global secrets
+ backup buckets
+ loophole tokens(?)
* home-manager [2/9]
** TODO Use home-manager
** TODO syncthing
can use phone for always up machine
can sync game data (homm3 saves, minecraft worlds, etc)
** TODO move user packages here (emacs config dependencies, etc.)
*** maybe move some of emacs config to nix(?)
  + prebuilt packages

*** prettier
*** ccls
*** prolog installation (for ediprolog(?))
*** i3 stuff
** TODO tmpfs home
if using home-manager maybe snapshotting specific directories is bettter
persistent-home directory and simlink subdirs from there?

  https://elis.nu/blog/2020/06/nixos-tmpfs-as-home/

  also gpg and ssh keys. should not in backup, +maybe yet another subvolume?+ put in /nix/persist/<username>


  TL;DR: high investment but HUGE in ease of backups
  
*** TODO Organize home dir
*** TODO mounting scheme
subvolumes:
+ @persistent
+ @persistent/home/<username> <- snapper goes here

@persistent/misc/<username> -- not a subvolume; this is not backed up
@persistent/misc/<username> is only for persistent files that should not be in backup (gpg db, browser data(?), docker, etc.)

** DONE look more into secret management [1/1]
*** +TODO kaggle token+
syncthing(?)
*** DONE email accounts (?)
probably should be in password-store
** +DONE CI/CD+ (will be included with system config)
** DONE change window managers -- keeping i3 for now
Using a keybind daemon for application launching could make transitions easier
X is dying but xdotool >>> ydotool (due to ewmh)
*** Options
++ Xmonad+
++ dwm+
+ keep i3
  + solve issues with multiple screens
  + implement features with i3-msg
  + big pro: wayland support with sway
  + can generate config with nix or other preprocessor
+ qtile
++ river+

** TODO switch to eww for ricing purposes
** Starship term prompt(?)
** TODO Productivity Configuration
*** TODO Ace-jump like functionality for windows / monitors
need to decide on wm first (or wm agnostic?)
*** TODO wm respects emacs windows or emacs frame-only mode
**** wm respects emacs windows
can use `emacsclient -e (windmove <direction>)` but also need a way to override this and force a window change focus
**** frame-only mode
default layout is dogwater (fixable from wm); also having some temporary frames as floating could be worth looking into
*** TODO better configuration for work stuff in emacs
**** js/ react
***** LSP
***** tree-sitter(?)
***** macros
**** php
***** God help me
**** SQL
***** completion
***** +superset integration+ emacs connection to bigquery is better or use superset api
+qutebrowser seems good enough for this+
*** TODO qutebrowser 
figure out kb-only inspect element
integrate pass
set better user agent
*** TODO pomodoro timer
**** Keybinds
+ pomodoro-step
  start focus / break timer
+ pomodoro-expand
  add 5 minutes to current timer
+ pomodoro-skip
  skips to the end of current timer
**** Display
on bar: remaining minutes (or just color green->red red means less time)
command to show accurate time
** Useful keybinds
+ pass ui
+ select monitor
  + move workspace to monitor
  + focus monitor
  + etc.
+ agenda dashboard (org google calendar etc.)
+ rebuild nix config (+ for home manager)
* Misc
** use gcm with pass backend
** set up vpn
** migrate to gopass or passage
gopass works with passff and age encryption so win-win tbh
*** Key rotation
public keys in repo and multiple recipients will allow for key rotations:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
each machine has its own key
public keys are all in the store

machine A wants to rotate keys

replaces the public key in the store;
encrypts the store with the new receipients

might be a headache in merging
#+END_EXAMPLE

Could set up a chron job for this to execute every 2 weeks on linux

age encryption doesn't work in android password store :'( maybe time for a PR.
