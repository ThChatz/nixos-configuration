* TODO nix-os [1/10]
** DONE Move to flakes
** TODO use deploy-rs for managing different systems + home-manager
** TODO erase root on reboot
https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/
something like this /could/ work for /home with home-manager
https://elis.nu/blog/2020/06/nixos-tmpfs-as-home/
** TODO Use home-manager
** TODO tmpfs home
** TODO cron job for snapshotting home directory
*** TODO Alternative mounting scheme for home-manager
if using home-manager maybe snapshotting specific directories is bettter
persistent-home directory and simlink subdirs from there?

distinct '@<username>-persistent' subvolume,
mount at /home/<username>/.persistent, symlink
Documents, Pictures, Music, Public, Videos
(maybe downloads as well but maybe not to force organize ;))
snapshot persistent home instead
  https://elis.nu/blog/2020/06/nixos-tmpfs-as-home/

  also gpg and ssh keys. should not in backup, +maybe yet another subvolume?+ put in /nix/persist/<username>


  TL;DR: high investment but HUGE in ease of backups
** TODO CI/CD
** TODO remote backup system [0/2]
*** TODO git-annex to cloud for specific files
git-annex could also help to reduce snapshot size if i ever store
snapshots on object storage
*** TODO btrfs-send 

** TODO global secrets
+ backup buckets
+ loophole tokens(?)
** TODO Set up services
*** TODO ssh w/ pgp key for backups
* home-manager [2/8]
** TODO syncthing
** TODO look more into secret management [1/2]
*** TODO kaggle token
syncthing(?)
*** DONE email accounts (?)
probably should be in password-store
** DONE +CI/CD+ (will be included with system config)
** DONE change window managers -- keeping i3 for now
Using a keybind daemon for application launching could make transitions easier
X is dying but xdotool >>> ydotool (due to ewmh)
*** Options
++ Xmonad+
++ dwm+
+ keep i3
  + solve issues with multiple screens
  + implement features with i3-msg
  + big pro: wayland support with sway
  + can generate config with nix or other preprocessor
+ qtile
++ river+

** TODO switch to eww for ricing purposes
** Starship term prompt(?)
** TODO maybe move some of emacs config to nix(?)
  + prebuilt packages
** TODO move user packages here (emacs config dependencies, etc.)
*** prettier
*** ccls
*** prolog installation (for ediprolog(?))
** TODO Productivity Configuration
*** TODO Ace-jump like functionality for windows / monitors
need to decide on wm first (or wm agnostic?)
*** TODO wm respects emacs windows or emacs frame-only mode
**** wm respects emacs windows
can use `emacsclient -e (windmove <direction>)` but also need a way to override this and force a window change focus
**** frame-only mode
default layout is dogwater (fixable from wm); also having some temporary frames as floating could be worth looking into
*** TODO better configuration for work stuff in emacs
**** js/ react
***** LSP
***** tree-sitter(?)
***** macros
**** php
***** God help me
**** SQL
***** completion
***** superset integration
qutebrowser seems good enough for this
*** TODO qutebrowser 
figure out kb-only inspect element
integrate pass
set better user agent
*** TODO pomodoro timer
**** Keybinds
+ pomodoro-step
  start focus / break timer
+ pomodoro-expand
  add 5 minutes to current timer
+ pomodoro-skip
  skips to the end of current timer
**** Display
on bar: remaining minutes (or just color green->red red means less time)
command to show accurate time
** Useful keybinds
+ pass ui
+ select monitor
  + move workspace to monitor
  + focus monitor
  + etc.
+ agenda dashboard (org google calendar etc.)
+ rebuild nix config (+ for home manager)
